title: Always set validity duration of presigned URLs with AWS S3 SDK

I was using [Drive module of AdonisJS](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/drive) to generate a presigned URL for a document, without configuring when the document would expire â€“ I was assuming that the default behavior would be to generate a URL that never expires. It appeared that the presigned URL was expiring 15 minutes after its generation.

Drive module is using [`getSignedUrl`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getSignedUrl-property) function from AWS S3 JavaScript SDK, which defaults to a validity of 15 minutes.

It's necessary to set a validity duration suitable for your project. This is how to do it with Drive module of AdonisJS:

```ts
const presignedUrl = await Drive.getSignedUrl(path, {
    expiresIn: '6 hours',
})
```
