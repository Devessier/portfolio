This is my portfolio. I used [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to build it ðŸŽ‰.


It's a PWA ([Progressive Web Application](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/)) that can be used offline :

This website is also my personal blog.

I created a [tool to scaffold a new blog post](./drone.js). It can be run with the following command:

```bash
node drone generate-article 'The title of the blog post'
```
